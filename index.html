Occasionally though, I’ll go off-road and do a game jam, or control Christmas lights with an Arduino. The multi-disciplinary passion stems from the fact the earliest things I was coding were Minecraft mods & FIRST robots.</p>

              <p class="position__description">As a software engineer, I worked alongside a small team to rebuild the entire DoSomething.org core user experience using React and Redux. Along the way, I independently built many critical features such as collecting user interaction data, supporting social authentication, and making user-facing products like Quizzes. Additionally, I took a deeper role in working with product managers and non-technical teams to determine our product roadmap.</p>

              <p class="position__description">As a junior engineer, I had the opportunity to bounce around many initiatives across DoSomething.org. This work included working with others to globalize the organizations Drupal app, building out real-time SMS chatbots and creating other internal micro-services. In this position, I also got introduced to resolving bug bounties and running tech for DoSomething live events every six months.</p>

This work led to me continuing the internship throughout my final year of school and working on the DoSomething Drupal application alongside other full-time engineers.</p>
