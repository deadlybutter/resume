              <p class="position__description">At LetAmericaVote I've worked on numerous products and prototypes designed to engage the community with civic actions. Most recently, we started work on a web project designed to get high school seniors registered to vote and to have their schools competing against each other. Before that, I worked closely with the digital director on prototyping a new user experience for the core website and experimenting with a Facebook bot.</p>

              <p class="position__description">As a software engineer, I worked alongside a small team to rebuild the entire DoSomething.org core user experience using React and Redux. Along the way, I independently built many critical features such as collecting user interaction data, supporting social authentication, and making user-facing products like Quizzes. Additionally, I took a deeper role in working with product managers and non-technical teams to determine our product roadmap.</p>

              <p class="position__description">As a junior engineer, I had the opportunity to bounce around many initiatives across DoSomething.org. This work included working with others to globalize the organizations Drupal app, building out real-time SMS chatbots and creating other internal micro-services. In this position, I also got introduced to resolving bug bounties and running tech for DoSomething live events every six months.</p>

              <p class="position__description">As a summer intern, I hooked into the DoSomething.org real-time activity streams and built a dashboard that was shipped and displayed in the office lobby. This work led to me continuing the internship throughout my final year of school and working on the DoSomething Drupal application alongside other full-time engineers.</p>
